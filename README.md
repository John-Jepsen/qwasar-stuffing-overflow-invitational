# Thanksgiving Game Lab (4 mini games)

Quick bundle of Thanksgiving-themed browser games. Each folder is a standalone game you can run locally and tweak.

## Play fast
1) Pick a folder: `turkey-tetris`, `pumpkin-catapult`, `turkey-dash`, or `escape-stuffing`.
2) Start a local server inside that folder (examples):
   - Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
   - Node: `npx http-server -p 8000`
3) Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## What’s inside
- `turkey-tetris`: Reskin Tetris with Thanksgiving blocks and sounds.
- `pumpkin-catapult`: Tune p5.js catapult physics and targets.
- `turkey-dash`: Endless runner with jumps, slides, dash, and power-ups.
- `escape-stuffing`: p5.js maze escape with timer and textures.

## Tips
- Edit each game’s `README.md` and `config.js` for controls, assets, and difficulty.
- Use a local server (not `file://`) so images and code load correctly.
- Swap assets with PNGs that have transparency for easiest results.
